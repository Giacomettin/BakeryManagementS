This Java-based Confectionery Management System is designed to facilitate the operations of a confectionery business. It provides a set of features for managing sales, production, and real-time monitoring. The system includes the following key components:

Model: Contains classes representing business entities, such as orders, products, customers, and employees.

DAO (Data Access Object): Includes classes responsible for interacting with a MySQL database, handling data access and management.

Service Layer: Implements the core business logic, covering functionalities like sales and production management.

User Interface (UI): Provides a user-friendly interface for creating orders, managing customers, and overseeing operations in real-time.

Utilities: Houses utility classes for configurations and other functions.

The system can be customized to suit the needs of a confectionery business, from handling orders and customers to monitoring production and sales. It offers a flexible structure that can be expanded and modified to meet specific requirements.

Feel free to use, modify, or contribute to this open-source project to enhance the management of your confectionery business.

Here are some explanations:

model/: This package contains classes that represent business entities, such as Order, Product, Customer, Employee, etc. These classes contain attributes and methods related to these entities.

dao/: This package contains Data Access Object (DAO) classes that are responsible for interacting with the database. Each entity (e.g., Order, Product, Customer) will have its own DAO.

service/: Here, you can place classes that contain the business logic for different services in the system, such as sales and production. These classes can orchestrate operations related to these services.

ui/: This package contains classes related to the user interface. You can have classes for the main window, order panels, customer panels, and other parts of the user interface.

util/: Utility classes can be placed here. This may include classes for configuration, date utilities, report generation, etc.

AppMain.java: This is the main entry point for your application. It's the class that initializes the system and manages the user interface and business operations.

README.md: A documentation file that describes the project and provides information on how to set up and run the system.
